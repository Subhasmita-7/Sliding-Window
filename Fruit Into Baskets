Input :fruits = [1, 2, 1]
Output :3
Explanation : We will start from first tree.
The first tree produces the fruit of kind '1' and we will put that in the first basket.
The second tree produces the fruit of kind '2' and we will put that in the second basket.
The third tree produces the fruit of kind '1' and we have first basket that is already holding fruit of kind '1'. So we will put it in first basket.
Hence we were able to collect total of 3 fruits.


class Solution {
    public int totalFruits(int[] fruits) {
        //your code goes here
        int maxlen = 0;
        int last = -1;
        int seclast = -1;
        int streak = 0;
        int curr = 0;

        for(int fruit : fruits){
          if(fruit == last || fruit == seclast){
            curr++;
          }
          else{
            curr = streak+1;
          }

          if(fruit == last){
            streak++;
          }
          else{
            streak = 1;
            seclast = last;
            last = fruit;
          }
          maxlen = Math.max(maxlen , curr);
        } 
        return maxlen;
    }
}
